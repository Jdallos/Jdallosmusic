    <br>
    <br>
    <p class='basic-text about-intro'>J Dallos is a singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who writes songs about
        life.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class='basic-text opener about-faq'>About music</p>
    <p class='basic-text content about-hidden'>I make music that is fun to play and that is meaningful to me. One of my
        favourite
        things about
        music is its ability to bring you into the present moment and hold you there with some stability.
        <br>
        <br>
        I rarely have
        a idea in mind of what I plan to write about before writing a song. Ocassionally words just come into my head
        while I'm busy doing something
        else
        but usually I create some music and play it over and over again until the words
        appear. I'm sure this is a similar experience for many songwriters- less of a trying to make something and more
        allowing it to happen. I feel very grateful to hear the songs when they are done and having this kind of
        attitude helps me not take my songs or peoples likes or dislikes about them too seriously.
        <br>
        <br>
        I'm not great at
        placing music in genres and have no strong sense of what genre my music really is, but I enjoy it and I hope you
        do too!.
    </p>
    <p class='basic-text opener about-faq'>About lyrics</p>
    <p class='basic-text content about-hidden'>
        Hmm, I can see why so many songwriters don't like to answer this question. I've really connected with songs
        before and
        then found out they mean something to the writer completely different to what they mean to me. Luckily I don't
        think thats a problem, I think it's kind of magical that 'stuff' can mean different 'things' to different
        people.
        <br>
        <br>
        That said
        I'm really interested
        in the subjective nature of mind, attention, meditation, technology, addiction, culture, suffering, being and
        becoming happy/ peaceful, and the meaning of
        life!
        All these heavily influence my songwriting.
        <br>
        <br>
        I write songs that I would like to hear and they are created with
        the
        intention of cultivating peace in the listener. My songs also serve as kind of reminder of the valuable things
        in life and how to best stay grounded in them- without being too opinionated about it!
    </p>
    <p class='basic-text opener about-faq'>About you</p>
    <p class='basic-text content about-hidden'>I grew up in the north of England: Hull, York, Leeds. I started playing
        music when I
        was 14, my first instrument was a freshman bass- I still have it! Within a few weeks of plucking my first notes
        I
        wrote a song as an apology for accidently breaking a chair (rock and roll!). Turns out I enjoyed writing lyrics
        so I carried on doing it and encourage others to do the same!
        <br>
        <br>
        I've been lucky enough to play with many incredibly talented musicians over the years who have basically taught
        me how to play. They've influenced
        my own songwriting and approach to music and we've had some great times along the way- with more to come! For me
        one of the most
        inspiring things about music is to discover there are so many people who are musicians that it's simply a
        privilege to listen to- they're
        on every street.
        <br>
        <br>
        I moved to Finland in 2020 where
        I'm currently
        enjoying living pretty much in the middle of the forest.
    </p>
    <p class='basic-text opener about-faq'>Influences </p>
    <p class='basic-text content about-hidden'>Aside from all the non-famous folks I've had the pleasure of sharing my
        musical journey with? Well there are so so many...
        <br>
        <br>
        My favourite artist has been John Frusciante for a while now,
        not least because listening to his music gave me a greater insight into my own music and music more generally.
        That's what I look for in a great song, something that reveals all music- all of life in fact- to be filled with
        ever
        deepening beauty and poignancy.
        <br>
        <br>
        There are a lot of influences that I'd do no justice by simply listing here. I really feel there is so
        much incredible life-changing music out there, old and new- be open to it. Good times!
